Anaconda provides a good python powered environment for scientific research. One of the most used library in image processing, [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), is also supported by [Anaconda community](https://anaconda.org/menpo/opencv3). To install OpenCV using conda, run the following command.

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

# About AIMLAB Docs

AIMLAB documentation (AIMLAB Docs) is an open repository of collections of knowledge usually used in AIMLAB. As a laboratory in academic institute, we have learned and tried many things. However, knowledge has never been noted in place, they are all scattered. AIMLAB Docs is an idea to solve the problem by collecting what we have known or learnt in one place. All the docs in this repository is hosted on GitHub and are all open for the sake of learning.

To contribute to this AIMLAB Docs project, ones can follow contribution guide which is also provided in the documentation.
